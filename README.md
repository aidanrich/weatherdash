# weatherdash

## Description

- The goal was the create a Weather Dashboard that would be able to display data based on a city search.
- The dashboard needed to make an API call to recieve the data, and then parse it so that we could display the relevant information.
- This activity once again challanged us to figure out what's possible with JS, and added in concepts like local storage and third party APIs.
